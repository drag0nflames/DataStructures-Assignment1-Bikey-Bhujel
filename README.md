## Challenges Overview

1. **The Array Artifact**: Implemented a class `ArtifactVault` to manage ancient artifacts using an array. I included methods to add, remove, find, and search for artifacts.

2. **The Linked List Labyrinth**: Created a `LabyrinthPath` class using a singly linked list to manage locations in a labyrinth. Implemented methods for adding, removing locations, checking for loops, and printing the path.

3. **The Stack of Ancient Texts**: Developed a `ScrollStack` class to manage ancient scrolls using a stack. Included methods to push, pop, peek, and check for a specific scroll.

4. **The Queue of Explorers**: Implemented an `ExplorerQueue` class using a circular queue to manage explorers. Included methods to enqueue, dequeue, peek, and check if the queue is full or empty.

5. **The Binary Tree of Clues**: Created a `ClueTree` class representing a binary tree of clues with methods to insert clues, perform traversals, find a specific clue, and count the total number of clues.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions
- Each data structure is implemented with its own dedicated class for clarity.
- Assumed that the input data (e.g., clues, scroll titles) is always valid.

## Instructions to Run the Code
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the `src` directory.
- Compile the Java files using `javac` and run the desired class using `java`.
